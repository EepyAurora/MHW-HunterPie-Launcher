This is a WIP launcher for monster hunter world designed to launch hunterpie as long as monster hunter is launched.
It currently only works if launched manually through a code editor and if you manually input the paths for both involved .exe files

Will continue to work on this and improve it over time, and hopefully be able to eventually link it into to the steam launcher and have it run automatically.
